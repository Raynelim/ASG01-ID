ASG01-ID — Windbreaker Fan Website

This project is a simple fan site based on the anime/manga 'Windbreaker'. The goal was to create a clean, easy-to-navigate website that highlights the main characters, the story, and some fan-style merchandise in a fun and visually appealing way.
It also acts as a portfolio peice, to demonstrate my ability to create a website.

Design Process

When planning this website, I kept one main group of users in mind:
- Fans of Windbreaker who want a quick and simple place to browse character info, look at and purchase merch, or learn the basic storyline.

I focused on keeping things straightforward: clear sections, simple fonts, readable text, and visual consistency. The images are organised into folders to make the site easier to maintain, and the layout is intentionally minimal so the content stands out.

User Stories
- "As a Windbreaker fan, I want to see my favourite characters easily, so that I can explore the series at a glance."
- "As someone new to the series, I want quick information about the plot, so that I understand what the anime/manga is about."
