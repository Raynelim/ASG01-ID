                    <p>Ren Kaji is a second-year student at Furin High School and serves as one of the grade captains in Bofurin. Easily recognizable by his blonde hair with darker roots and the lollipop constantly in his mouth, Kaji has a reputation for having a short temper that he constantly works to control. His lollipops serve as a coping mechanism to help him manage his anger and maintain composure in tense situations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite his volatile nature, Kaji is a highly capable fighter and a dedicated leader who takes his responsibilities seriously. He cares deeply about his classmates and the mission of Bofurin, though he often expresses this care through stern words and tough-love approaches. His journey involves learning to better control his emotions while channeling his passion into productive leadership and protection of his community.</p>

                    <h3>Hot-Tempered Fighter</h3>
                    <p>Kaji has a naturally short fuse and can become agitated quickly, especially when things don't go according to plan or when he perceives injustice. His anger is genuine and powerful, but he's acutely aware of this weakness and actively works to control it through various coping mechanisms, particularly his signature lollipops.</p>

                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Responsible Leader</h3>
                    <p>As a grade captain, Kaji takes his duties seriously and feels personally responsible for the wellbeing of his classmates. While he may seem harsh or impatient at times, his strictness comes from a place of genuine concern. He pushes others to be better because he believes in their potential and wants them to be prepared for challenges ahead.</p>

                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Self-Aware Growth</h3>
                    <p>Unlike many hot-headed characters, Kaji is highly self-aware about his anger issues and actively seeks ways to improve. His use of lollipops represents his commitment to self-control and finding non-violent outlets for his frustration. This self-awareness and dedication to personal growth make him a more effective leader despite his temper.</p>
