                <div class="overview-text">
                    <p>Toma Hiragi serves as the vice-captain of Bofurin and is a second-year student at Furin High School. Distinguished by his light-colored hair and perpetually stressed expression, Hiragi is known for his chronic stomach problems that flare up whenever he deals with stressful situations—which, given his position and personality, happens frequently. He constantly carries stomach medication and can often be seen popping pills to manage his stress-induced ailments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite his health issues and tendency to worry, Hiragi is an incredibly capable leader and fighter. His dedication to Bofurin and his genuine care for his peers make him Umemiya's most trusted lieutenant. While he may complain and stress about various situations, Hiragi always steps up when needed, demonstrating reliability and strength that make him worthy of his vice-captain position. His relationship with Umemiya is both comedic and heartfelt, as he often plays the straight man to the leader's more carefree personality.</p>

                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Chronic Worrier</h3>
                    <p>Hiragi is a natural worrywart who stresses about everything from major conflicts to minor organizational details. His anxiety manifests physically through severe stomach problems, requiring him to constantly take medication. Despite this burden, his worrying often proves useful as he thinks ahead and prepares for potential problems that others might overlook.</p>

                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Reliable Vice-Captain</h3>
                    <p>As Umemiya's right-hand man, Hiragi handles much of the practical leadership and organization within Bofurin. He's the one who ensures things run smoothly, manages conflicts, and maintains order. His responsible nature and attention to detail complement Umemiya's more idealistic and carefree leadership style, making them an effective team.</p>

                    <h3>Tough Love Mentor</h3>
                    <p>While he genuinely cares about his juniors and teammates, Hiragi often expresses this care through stern lectures and tough-love approaches. He's not afraid to scold or criticize when necessary, believing that honest feedback helps people grow. Beneath his harsh exterior lies deep concern for everyone's wellbeing and development.</p>

                    <h3>Rising Through Ranks</h3>
                    <p>Hiragi's combination of fighting ability, leadership skills, and unwavering dedication earned him the position of vice-captain, second only to Umemiya. His rise wasn't just about strength but also his ability to handle responsibility and make tough decisions when necessary. He became the person Umemiya could trust to manage things in his absence.</p>

                <div class="story-block">
                    <h3>Partnership with Umemiya</h3>
                    <p>Hiragi's relationship with Umemiya is central to his role in Bofurin. While he often complains about Umemiya's carefree attitude and sometimes reckless approach, there's deep mutual respect between them. Hiragi understands and supports Umemiya's vision for Bofurin, even when it causes him stress. Their dynamic balances idealism with pragmatism.</p>

                    <h3>Managing Stress</h3>
                    <p>The pressure of his position and his naturally anxious personality have given Hiragi chronic stomach problems that require constant medication. Rather than letting this weakness sideline him, he's learned to manage it as part of his daily routine. His condition makes him more relatable and human, showing that even strong leaders struggle with personal challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Current Role</h3>
                    <p>As vice-captain, Hiragi serves as the backbone of Bofurin's operations, handling day-to-day management and providing support to both Umemiya and the grade captains. He mentors younger members while dealing with his own stress, proving that leadership isn't about being perfect but about showing up and doing your duty despite personal struggles. His dedication inspires others to push through their own challenges.</p>
