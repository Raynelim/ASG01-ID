                    <p>Haruka Sakura is the main protagonist of Wind Breaker, a first-year student at Furin High School with a fierce reputation and distinctive appearance. Born with heterochromia—one yellow eye and one blue eye—and split-toned black and white hair, Sakura has always stood out from the crowd, often facing discrimination and isolation throughout his childhood.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite his rough exterior and tendency to get into fights, Sakura possesses a strong sense of justice and an unwavering desire to protect those who cannot protect themselves. His journey at Furin High marks a turning point in his life, where he learns the true meaning of strength, friendship, and community.</p>

                    <p>Sakura's childhood was marked by isolation and prejudice due to his unique appearance. His heterochromia and distinctive hair color made him a target for bullying and exclusion. Rather than succumbing to this treatment, Sakura learned to fight, using his fists to survive and protect himself from those who would harm him.</p>

                    <p>Seeking to prove himself as the strongest, Sakura deliberately chose to attend Furin High School, known for its reputation as a school of delinquents. However, he quickly discovered that Furin and its organization, Bofurin, were nothing like he expected. Instead of mindless violence, he found a group dedicated to protecting the town and its people.</p>

Through encounters with upperclassmen like Hajime Umemiya and peers like Hayato Suo and Akihiko Nirei, he begins to see the value in fighting not just for himself, but for others and the community.</p>
