                    <p>Hayato Suo is one of the main characters in Wind Breaker and a first-year student at Furin High School. Distinguished by his calm demeanor, mysterious eyepatch, and traditional Chinese-inspired clothing, Suo stands out as one of the most enigmatic members of Bofurin. His composed nature and sophisticated fighting style contrast sharply with the raw power of many of his peers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite his serene exterior, Suo is an exceptionally skilled martial artist with extensive training in Chinese martial arts. His fighting philosophy centers on precision, technique, and maintaining emotional control. He serves as a stabilizing presence among his classmates, often acting as a voice of reason while concealing deeper mysteries about his past and the true extent of his abilities.</p>

                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Combat Style</h3>
                    <p>Suo employs refined martial arts techniques rooted in traditional Chinese fighting styles. His movements are precise and calculated, utilizing leverage, timing, and opponent manipulation rather than brute force. He excels at reading his opponents and exploiting their weaknesses with minimal wasted effort.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Demeanor</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining an almost perpetual smile and polite manner, Suo presents himself as gentle and approachable. However, this pleasant facade masks a more complex personality. He can be subtly teasing and occasionally displays a darker, more intimidating side when the situation demands it, especially when protecting his friends.</p>

                <div class="personality-card">
                    <h3>Mystery</h3>
                    <p>Suo is deliberately secretive about his past, his eyepatch, and the full extent of his martial arts training. While friendly and social, he carefully controls what information he reveals about himself. This air of mystery makes him both intriguing and slightly unnerving to those around him.</p>

                    <h3>Mysterious Origins</h3>
                    <p>Little is known about Suo's life before arriving at Furin High School. His extensive martial arts training and sophisticated fighting techniques suggest a rigorous upbringing focused on combat discipline. The eyepatch he wears and his traditional clothing hint at a deeper, more complex backstory that he chooses not to share openly with others.</p>

                    <h3>Arrival at Furin</h3>
                    <p>Suo joined Furin High School as a first-year student, quickly establishing himself as one of the most capable fighters in his class. His calm demeanor and obvious skill immediately set him apart from typical delinquents. Rather than seeking to dominate through intimidation, Suo naturally commands respect through competence and composure.</p>

                    <h3>Friendship with Sakura</h3>
                    <p>Suo became one of Haruka Sakura's first genuine friends at Furin High. Their contrasting personalities—Sakura's hot-headed directness versus Suo's calm calculation—create a balanced dynamic. Suo often acts as a moderating influence on Sakura while genuinely respecting his strength and determination. Their friendship demonstrates Suo's loyalty and protective nature toward those he cares about.</p>

His ability to remain calm under pressure makes him invaluable during conflicts. While he doesn't seek leadership roles, his insights and suggestions carry significant weight among his peers, who recognize his wisdom beyond his years.</p>
