                <div class="overview-text">
                    <p>Kyutaro Sugishita is a second-year student at Furin High School and one of the most formidable fighters in Bofurin. Distinguished by his tall stature, long dark hair, and perpetually serious expression, Sugishita is known for his near-silent demeanor and unwavering devotion to Hajime Umemiya. He rarely speaks, preferring to let his actions and incredible fighting prowess communicate for him.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite his intimidating appearance and violent fighting style, Sugishita harbors deep respect and loyalty toward Umemiya, whom he considers the ultimate authority. His dedication borders on fanatical—he becomes instantly hostile toward anyone he perceives as disrespecting or threatening Umemiya. This fierce protectiveness makes him both a powerful ally and a dangerous adversary, as he will stop at nothing to defend those he deems worthy of his loyalty.</p>

                    <p>Initially hostile toward Haruka Sakura due to perceiving disrespect toward Umemiya, Sugishita viewed the first-year as an enemy. However, as Sakura proved his worth and earned Umemiya's acknowledgment, their relationship evolved into something resembling grudging respect, though still marked by competitive tension and occasional clashes.</p>
