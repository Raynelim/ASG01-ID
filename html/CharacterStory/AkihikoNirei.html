                    <p>Akihiko Nirei is a first-year student at Furin High School and one of the main supporting characters in Wind Breaker. Recognizable by his blonde hair and anxious demeanor, Nirei stands out not for his fighting prowess but for his exceptional intelligence and information-gathering abilities. He carries a detailed notebook containing extensive data on fighters, gangs, and important figures throughout the area.</p>
                    
                    <p>While initially appearing timid and lacking in combat ability, Nirei proves his worth to Bofurin through his analytical mind, strategic thinking, and unwavering loyalty to his friends. His courage grows throughout the series as he learns that being strong doesn't always mean being the best fighter—it means standing by your friends and using your unique strengths to support the team.</p>
